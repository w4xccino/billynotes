Uhmm I started to regret about not have gone to my English Classes today. I mean, this is my favorite date in the whole year and I'm here, in front of my screen, typing like a fucking loser. My GF has gone to France and she's is probably sleeping already. 

I don't know how to feel about myself. Am I a loser? Maybe just because I didn't go to my English classes I would lose the best day of the year? Should I feel like this? Probably I'll tell to my sister that I went to ELC but... IDK. I would like to play something to get those thoughts out of my mind but there's no one to play with...
So I'm here... without money, without friends, losing Halloween, but with an insane blog where to put all my feelings.
I was thinking about sharing it... but probably I won't do it.
