# Welcome
Hi everyone, I know this is kinda cliche for most of you. But I think the idea of make my own blog, with my own tools(but this is docusaurus) makes me feel so productive and pure. I need to be honest with myself starting to say I didn't go to my English Classes because I was doing this shit. I mean, it's not a shit itself, I really proud of this because It was sort of challenging for me. Specially the part of `Deployment`.

I followed a Youtube video and documentation as well. But I think tomorrow I'll link this, which is on GitHub Pages with my new web domain!!

Actually, I'd to create another blog using Org Mode Syntax. Currently, I don't know how to insert music here in order to put it sometimes further in the future.

Tomorrow, I'll add some documentation and guides that I would learn about DevOps and all that kind of crap where I really got into it. OMG!
