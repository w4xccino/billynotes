### What is DevOps?
Is a methodology that helps teams to build products **(faster, better)** by continuously integrating user feedback.

When we google about DevOps, we surely watch this image.

Back in the day, software was developed much like things would be develop in a factory. So any input would be programming and then the output we'd have a product. 

But since the creation of internet many things have changed. Specially the vision of it's really easy to launch things and get user feedback and finally integrate those new features into that product. In first instance it wasn't possible due to there wasn't a medium to implement those features. 

So, when internet appeared many websites like Facebook or Google continuosly upgrade insted of requiring you to buy a new version of the product. 

That idea is escencially what DevOps is. 

First of all we have these steps:
1. **Plan**: Where you take a set of features you wanna build.
2. **Coding**: Where developers build the features so they can be released.
3. **Build**: So for a website, you might take some source code and bundle it into a Javascript that user's browser could run. 
4. **Test**: This could be both automatic and manual. Automatic testing is coloquially known Continuous Integration (*CI*). Manual testing is coloquially known as Quality Assurance (*QA*). 
5. **Release**: So then after it's tested and the stakeholders haven all given their feedback, the product is released. And Continuous Deployment strategies, releasing and deploying everything happens automatically after a change is known to be good. The core idea is you want to take the software, and you want to send it to your users in a way they don't notice if there's problems. 
6. **Deploy**: Once the product has been released and has feedback of a few percentage of users, the whole release would be Deployed. 
7. **Operate**: Scaling, make sure there's enough resources.
8. **Monitor**: Create forums, or make the product active.
