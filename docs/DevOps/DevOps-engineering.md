## Definition
It's the practical use of DevOps methodology withing software engineering teams. Being able to test, build, release and monitor aplications.

## Subfield of DevOps
When you see a job post asking for a DevOps engineer, they're not asking for someone that can plan, deploy, code. They're mostly asking for someone who can build a test, release, deploy and monitor. 

## DevOps Engineering pillars
- **Pull request Automation**: This helps developers build things faster and helps them understand whether their proposed are good. 
- **Deployment Automation**:  Helps you to deploy your code in a way that users don't complain. 
- **Application Performance Management**: Automation about things are healthy. Down Time, Status about performace, everything automatic. 

## Pull Requests Automation

### What can be automated?
- **Continous Integration:** Automated test running
- **Per Change Ephemeral Evironment**
- **Automated Security Scanning**
- **Notifications to Reviewers**

### Goals as a DevOps Engineer
Help the developer's change purposals get review and merged in less 24 hours of when they're made. That's because some critical bugs can be very quickly fixed, merged and deployed without needing an special process. Escencially, developers aren't bogged down by in a boureucracy. They can purpose change once get through the gates, the change will be deployed.

So for example, if the proper gates and automations have been set up, a developer should be able to change a web change without having to ask everyone in the company. By virtue, passing all the tests and passing QA reviews, it's assumed that the new change is well made. And if a problem does arise, a new gate can be added to the automation so that in future problems don't occur.
